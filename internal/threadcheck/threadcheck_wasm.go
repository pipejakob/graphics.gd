// On wasm there is a single OS thread, so thread identity cannot tell the
// frame-driving code apart from free-running goroutines. Goroutine identity
// can: the wasm g register is read by currentg (see currentg_wasm.s) at a
// cost comparable to the native g-register thread check, and with no other
// threads there is no need for atomics on the variables below.

// currentg returns the current goroutine's g pointer (the wasm g register).
func currentg() uintptr

// mainG identifies the program's main goroutine. Package initialisers run on
// it, before any other goroutine can exist. The main goroutine is
// frame-aligned by construction: in Rendering()/Scene() mode the frame
// handshake lock-steps the engine to it (a frame cannot advance, and so the
// per-frame collection cannot run, while user main-loop code holds the frame
// slot), so its wrappers may safely be frame-temporaries.
var mainG = currentg()

// frameG identifies the goroutine currently executing an engine→Go export
// (see EnterFrame): while an engine callback runs, its goroutine is the
// frame-driving goroutine. Zero outside any callback. If callback code
// blocks, goroutines scheduled in the meantime do not match frameG (their g
// differs, and a parked g cannot be reused) and are treated as free-running.
var frameG uintptr

// may dispatch directly into the engine.

// engine→Go wasm export; enter/leave pairs nest like a stack, so re-entrant
// callbacks restore correctly.

// the Go garbage collector (see gd.Wrap*), because the per-frame collection
